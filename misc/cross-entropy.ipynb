    "At every step of the training process, we need to evaluate how well the model is doing. The true data distribution $P$ is given by the labels in the training dataset, while the model's predicted distribution $Q$ is given by the model's output. Ideally, our model's predicted distribution $Q$ should be as close as possible to the true data distribution $P$. That's sounds like a job for the KL divergence!\n",

    "In practice, we will minimize the cross-entropy $H(P, Q)$ instead of the KL divergence $D_{KL}(P \\| Q)$, because the entropy $H(P)$ does not depend on the model's parameters, and therefore does not affect the optimization process.\n",
    "Think about it: no matter what the model's parameters are, the entropy of the true data distribution $P$ will always be the same. So minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy. We don't care if they differ by a constant."
