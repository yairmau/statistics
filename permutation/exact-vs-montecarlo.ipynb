In the context of permutation tests, Monte Carlo methods do not compute the test statistic for every possible permutation of the data. In the examples from before, we computed 1000 permutations only, and from that we estimated the p-value of the test statistic. If we had run the test more than once, we would have obtained a different p-value each time, as the test statistic is computed from a random sample of permutations."
