I'm teaching myself statistics and machine learning, and the best way to truly understand is to use the new tools I've acquired. This is what this website is for. It is mainly a reference guide for my future self.

## books

These are the books that I've read and recommend.

Modern Statistics: Intuition, Math, Python, R  
by Mike X Cohen  
[Github](https://github.com/mikexcohen/statistics_book)

This is a really approachable book, the author has a very nice conversational style, and I enjoyed it a lot. Highly recommended

Data-Driven Science and Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control  
by Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz
The whole book is available in this [website](https://www.databookuw.com/).

This is the sort of books that is suitable for [those who already know the subject](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTBdMZ5XsAAeq8C.png){target="_blank"}. I would not recommend it as a first read. In any case, some chapters gave me new intuition on the subject. I do highly recommend [Steve Brunton's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Eigensteve/playlists){target="_blank"}, it's fantastic.

Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
by Michael Nielsen  

This is an online book, [freely available here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html){target="_blank"}.
It can be tiring to read a whole book on a computer screen, so you can find [Anton Vladyka's LaTeX rendition of this book](https://github.com/antonvladyka/neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.pdf){target="_blank"} in his GitHub repository. I wanted to read the pdf in my tiny kindle reader, so I recompiled Anton's LaTeX code to make it fit the screen, and on the way changed the font, and corrected typos here and there. [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hdmntcghxqym#98d001){target="_blank"}. [Download pdf](/archive/deep_learning.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Nielsen writes very well, I really enjoyed this book. The part on backprogation is a bit confusing, I would recommend watching [3b1b's youtube video](https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U?si=MvCRV8oDI_WvW5EH){target="_blank"} on that.
